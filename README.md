# Jack Ye (wwin3286tw)

Server board test engineer focused on **Linux-based test automation**, **hardware bring-up/validation**, and building **maintainable tooling** that makes debugging faster and results more reliable.

---

## What I do

* Design and maintain **repeatable test flows** for server boards in Linux environments
* Build **automation scripts and CLI tools** (mostly Python/Bash) to reduce manual steps
* Improve **observability**: structured logs, clear pass/fail criteria, faster failure triage
* Work across HW/SW boundaries: interface validation and practical debugging

---

## Skills

* **Linux**: Bash, systemd, CLI tooling, deployment & troubleshooting
* **Test Automation**: workflow design, data collection/validation, log analysis, failure triage
* **Python**: automation, tooling, data processing, CLI apps
* **Hardware / Embedded**: server board validation; interface concepts & practice (e.g., I2C/UART/USB)
* **Containers**: Docker / Docker Compose for reproducible environments
* **Electronics soldering (prototyping & rework)**: through-hole components; SOP-8/SOIC-8; ESP32 modules (castellated pads). Verification via visual inspection and multimeter continuity/short checks. Not currently equipped for fine-pitch QFN/BGA or other hidden-lead packages requiring microscope + stencil/reflow.

## Engineering values

* **Reproducibility**: same inputs → same results (controlled versions and environments)
* **Observability**: actionable logs, measurable signals, faster root-cause isolation
* **Maintainability**: tools and scripts are long-term assets, not one-off hacks

## Featured projects

* **Smart GPS Tracker (ESP32 + SPI SD Card)**
  A compact GPS logger built on ESP32 that records coordinates to a microSD card, then converts the collected CSV track into KML for visualization (e.g., Google Earth). Includes a simple bill of materials and an Arduino sketch-based workflow.

* **Cost Calculator Web**
  A lightweight web-based cost calculator focused on clear inputs, predictable calculation rules, and fast iteration for practical “estimate-first” workflows.

## Interests

* 3D printing (fixtures, enclosures, practical builds)
* Amateur radio communications (systems + real-world integration)
